# Simple Inventory System (CSV-only Tkinter Desktop App)

## Overview

This is a simple desktop application to manage a product inventory, designed for educational purposes and student assignments. The app lets you track products, stock quantities, suppliers, and automatically highlights items that are low in stock. It uses a CSV file for all data storageâ€”no database is required, and the code is kept simple and easy to understand.

The user interface is built with Python's Tkinter library. All product data is stored in a single CSV file (`products.csv` by default), which makes it easy to back up, share, or edit outside of the app.

## Features

- **Product Management**
  - Add new products with name, SKU, price, supplier, initial stock, and reorder level
  - Edit existing products
  - Delete products
  - Unique SKU enforcement

- **Stock Operations**
  - Adjust stock quantity up or down
  - Prevents negative stock (app will show an error if you try)

- **Low Stock Alerts**
  - Items at or below their reorder level are highlighted (yellow for low, red for zero)
  - "Show Low Stock" button to list only items needing reorder
  - Status bar shows count of low-stock items

- **CSV Import/Export**
  - Save and load inventory data from CSV files
  - Merge/import products from another CSV (matches by SKU)
  - Export your inventory to CSV for backup or sharing

- **SKU Validation**
  - SKU must be 4-20 characters, using only uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and hyphens (-)
  - Invalid SKUs will be rejected

- **Testing**
  - Comes with pytest-based automated tests for stock operations and low-stock alerts

- **Sample Data**
  - Includes `products.csv` with example products so you can see the app in action immediately

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or newer**  
  Tkinter is included with most Python installations.  
  - On Linux, if you get errors about Tkinter missing, install with:  
    `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

### Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Project**  
   Place all the files (including `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `products.csv`) in the same folder.

2. **Install pytest for running tests (optional)**  

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Application**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:
   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

   The graphical app will open and load the sample `products.csv`.

4. **Optional: Use a Different CSV File**  
   You can set the file to use with an environment variable:
   - Windows CMD:

     ```bat
     set INVENTORY_CSV_PATH=C:\path\to\yourfile.csv
     python main.py
     ```

   - PowerShell:

     ```powershell
     $env:INVENTORY_CSV_PATH="C:\path\to\yourfile.csv"
     python main.py
     ```

   - macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     export INVENTORY_CSV_PATH=/path/to/yourfile.csv
     python3 main.py
     ```

5. **Run Tests (optional, recommended for grading and assignment checks)**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## CSV File Format

The CSV file used for storage has these columns:

```csv
id,name,sku,price,stock,reorder_level,supplier
```

- `id` is auto-managed by the app (you don't need to edit it)
- `sku` must be unique and follow the format: 4-20 chars, uppercase A-Z, 0-9, hyphens
- Example row:

  ```csv
  1,USB Cable A-A,USBC-1001,3.99,25,5,WireWorks
  ```

When importing, the app matches products by SKU and updates their details.

## Screenshots

- **Main Table:** Lists all products, with low-stock items highlighted.
- **Add/Edit Dialog:** Enter product details in a simple form.
- **Adjust Stock Dialog:** Increase or decrease stock for a selected product.
- **Low Stock View:** Shows only items needing reorder.

## Extending the App

This code was designed to be easy for students to understand and modify.  
Possible stretch goals:

- Add multi-location inventory (add a location column)
- Barcode field for products
- Automatic reorder suggestions (export a reorder list to CSV)
